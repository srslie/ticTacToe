# Tic Tac Toe

Maybe you like tics. Perhaps you like tacs. Possibly you like toes.

If any of those sound like you, Tic Tac Toe is a classic game that will meet your needs!

This project allows two players to sit down together and play out a game of Tic Tac Toe; it will notify the winner and add a record of the score to their scoreboard. It will automatically reset the board to allow endless games, and allows the simple joy of logically outwitting an opponent for game and glory!

This is my final solo project for Mod 1 of Turing School.

## Contributors
